Project name:  Custom Theme WordPress = Theme Femke 

Description: 

For this project i am going to build a blog website theme for WordPress. So when activating my theme I want the website to work dynamically and within the same style.  The website will have a blog archive page where you can see all the blog posts that are being uploaded, single blog post pages where you can read the article and standard information that are placed on an website. 

Motivation
My motivation behind this is that i am used to making websites and webshops in WordPress and in many occasion i use a pre build theme and then start personalizing that theme to the clients liking, but i want to learn how to make my own theme and understand how such themes work.
