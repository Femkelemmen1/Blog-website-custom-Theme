Project name:  Custom Theme WordPress = Theme Femke 

Description: 

For this project i am going to build a blog website theme for WordPress. By activating my theme there will be an blog archive page where you can see all the blog posts that you upload on WordPress, single post pages are designed with dynamic tags, categories and comments.

Motivation
My motivation behind this is that i am used to making websites and webshops in WordPress and in many occasion i use a pre build theme and then start personalizing that theme to the clients liking, but i want to learn how to make my own theme and understand how such themes work.

How do people use it? 
Do you want to make a WordPress blog website and want to use a template to save development time? Then you can activate Theme Femke. This theme gives you the ability to upload blogposts and dynamically add them to the blog page. 

What would a next version include?)
- The next version includes a more advanced design for custom widgets. 
- It wil include more feature for other pages besides the blog single pages and archive page.
